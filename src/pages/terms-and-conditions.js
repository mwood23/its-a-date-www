                We do not assume any liability for any User Submissions posted
                by you or any other 3rd party Users of our Services. However,
                subject to your privacy rights and application settings, you
                grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable,
                sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any User
                Submissions that you post on or in connection with It's a Date
                (“IP License”). This only refers and applies to User Submissions
                posted via open communication tools, and does not refer to
                information that is provided as part of the registration
                process, necessary in order to use our Services. All information
                provided as part of our registration process is covered by our

              <li>
                We have the right at our sole discretion to remove any User
                Submission that, we feel in our judgment does not comply with
                this Agreement, along with any User Submission that we feel is
                otherwise offensive, harmful, objectionable, inaccurate, or
                violates any 3rd party copyrights or trademarks. We are not
                responsible for any delay or failure in removing such User
                Submission. If you post User Submission that we choose to
                remove, you hereby consent to such removal, and consent to waive
                any claim against us.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you delete an IP User Submission, it is deleted in a manner
                similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you
                understand that removed User Submission may persist in backup
                copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be

              <li>
                When you post or publish any User Submission or information, it
                means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of
                It's a Date, to access and use that information, and to
                associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).
              </li>
              <li>
                We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about

                suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them
                (just as you have no obligation to offer them).

              <li>
                You represent and warrant:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    You are the owner of (or have all the rights and permission
                    required to use) all the intellectual property rights in the
