"Any plans for the weekend?" The call heard at water coolers 'round the world. Do you have an answer ready? If not, there may be yet another offer for an awkward co-worker meetup at the Bennigan's down the road. You...think it's better than sitting at home on your phone with _Friends_ running in the background. Is it? It seems so in the office...but not once you're back in that sticky corner booth with a basket of soggy tater tots in front of you.

What's the alternative? The author grew up in Northern Virginia, 15 miles from the capital of the free world and said, "There's nothing to do here." But that's a big load. With the world on a 4G LTE connection to our pockets, we no longer have an excuse for going to the same two chain restaurants and a bowling alley. From speakeasies and river cruises to street art hunting and goat yoga, the options nowadays are near endless.

Let's start this week with a taste of sweet guitar licks, phaser blasts, and swelling orchestras: the music venues in D.C. you deserve to know about.



## **The Anthem**

Recently opened on The Wharf on the Georgetown Waterfront, this medium-sized venue caters to big name artists without putting you in the poor house (Verizon Center, _cough_). Owned by the same company as The 9:30 Club and Merriweather Post Pavilion, we're sure the place is in good hands.



## Flash DC

Looking for a more late-night, electronic vibe? More unique and intimate than Echostage by a long shot, Flash rises multiple stories into the skyline with international names in house music blasting sets on each level. Adventure through the Club Level, The Flash Bar, and the rooftop and check out the talent spinning on each stop. Come hydrated, it's a dancing affair.



## Gypsy Sally's

Calling all local flower-children-at-heart: if you parents kept vinyl and old jam band tees around the house you may have to stop through Gypsy Sally's for a show. Check out some smooth jams from Grateful Dead and Allman cover bands all the way up to '90s hits from White Ford Bronco. It feels like a cozy dive bar, and tickets are usually under $15. You can't go wrong.
