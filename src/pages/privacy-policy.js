            Cookies: We use “cookies” to keep track of some types of information
            while you are visiting It's a Date or using our services. “Cookies”
            are very small files placed on your computer, and they allow us to
            count the number of visitors to our Website and distinguish repeat
            visitors from new visitors. They also allow us and third parties we

            session cookies expire at the end of a particular visit to our
            Website, while persistent cookies (also called stored cookies)

            or until a pre-set expiration date. We rely on cookies for the
            proper operation of It's a Date; therefore if your browser is set to
            reject all cookies, It's a Date may not function properly. Users who
            refuse cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of
            functionality with respect to It's a Date.

            Web Beacons: “Web beacons” (also known as “clear gifs” and “pixel
            tags”) are small transparent graphic images that are often used in

            for our users, collect a limited set of information about our
            visitors, and advertise to our users. We may also use web beacons in
            email communications in order to understand the behavior of our
            customers, such as whether an email has been opened or acted upon.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Information you choose to provide:</p>
        <p>
          Information We Obtain From Facebook. In order to register with certain
          It's a Date apps, you may be asked to sign in using your Facebook
          login. If you do so, you are authorizing us to access and process
          certain Facebook account information, including information about you
          and your Facebook friends who might be common Facebook friends with
          other It's a Date users. By allowing us to access your Facebook
          account, you understand that we may obtain and process certain
          information from your Facebook account, including your name, email
          address, birthday, work history, education history, current city,
          pictures stored on Facebook, and the names, profile pictures,
          relationship status, and information about your Facebook friends. We
          only obtain information from your Facebook account that you
          specifically authorize and grant us permission to obtain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information You Provide Directly to Us. In addition, when you register
          with certain It's a Date apps, you must provide certain information,
          including your email address, zip code, and gender. We will also ask
          you to upload photos for your profile and may collect any information
          (including location metadata and inferred characterizations or data)
          contained in these files. You may provide additional information about
          yourself (such as your school, occupation, current city, etc.) in
          order to build your It's a Date profile. You may also provide “special
          categories of personal data” under applicable law, such as your race,
          ethnicity, religion, philosophical or political views, and information
          relating to your sex life or sexual orientation. By affirmatively
          providing It's a Date with this information, you explicitly consent to
          our use of it for the purpose of fine tuning your match criteria with
          other people. Any information that you provide in the non-personal
          identifiable section of your profile will be viewable by your match.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emails: We require an email address from you when you register with
          certain It's a Date apps. We use your email for both “administrative”
          (e.g., confirming your registration, notifying of matches) and
          “promotional” (e.g., newsletters, new product offerings, special
          discounts, event notifications, special third- party offers) purposes.
          Email messages we send you may contain code that enables our database
          to track your usage of the e-mails, including whether the e-mail was
          opened and what links (if any) were clicked. You may opt-out of
          receiving promotional emails and other promotional communications from
          us at any time via the opt-out links provided in such communications,
          or by e-mailing support@itsadate.app with your specific request.
          However, we reserve the right to send you certain communications
          relating to It's a Date such as service announcements, security
          alerts, update notices, or other administrative messages) without
          affording you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such
          communications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Text Messages: In certain apps, we may require a mobile telephone
          number in order to connect you with your match. When both you and your
          match explicitly express mutual interest by both clicking the “LIKE”
          button within It's a Date, we will seek to connect you with him/her by
          text message. We will also share your first name at this time with
          your match. We do not share your phone number with your match during
          this process, as all introductory text messages are sent using third
          party generated phone numbers. We may also send text messages to your
          mobile phone for purposes of communicating with you about It's a Date.
          By registering with It's a Date and providing your phone number, you
          consent to It's a Date sending you text messages via an automatic
          telephone dialing system. Your use of It's a Date is not contingent
          upon agreeing to receive text messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Online Survey Data: We may periodically conduct voluntary member
          surveys. We encourage our members to participate in such surveys
          because they provide us with important information regarding the
          improvement of It's a Date. We do not link the survey responses to
          your name or email address, and all responses are anonymous.

        </p>
        <h2>Individual Rights in the European Economic Area</h2>
        <p>
          If you are located in the European Economic Area, you may seek
          confirmation regarding whether It's a Date is processing personal
          information about you, request access to your personal information and
          ask that we correct, amend, delete, or restrict processing of your
          personal information. In addition, you may object to It's a Date’s
          processing of your personal information at any time. However doing so
          may impact your use of It's a Date.
        </p>
        <p>
          If applicable law provides you the right to request access to,
          (receive) port, object to or restrict processing, seek rectification
          or request erasure of personal information held about you by It's a
          Date, you may do so, as applicable, through the controls in the It's a

        </p>
        <p>
          Although It's a Date makes good faith efforts to provide users with
          access to their personal information, there may be circumstances in
          which It's a Date is unable to provide access, including but not
          limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would
          compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the
          burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the
          risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question, where the
          request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, or where the information
          sought is commercially proprietary.
